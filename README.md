# BASE64 ENCODE AND DECODE TOOLS
This is a simple Python script library that provides Base64 encoding and decoding functionalities. You can use these scripts to easily encode or decode files in Base64 format.
Base64 encoding is commonly used in data transmission, especially when dealing with binary data (such as images, files, etc.), converting them into printable ASCII characters.
# Feature
  ● Base64 Encoding: Converts a string or file content into Base64 encoding.
  ● Base64 Decoding: Decodes a Base64 encoded string back to its original content.
# Usage
Before running the scripts, you need to install the required Python packages, including python-magic and python-magic-bin
  pip install python-magic python-magic-bin
or download the requirements.txt and type
  pip install -r requirements.txt
1. Base64 Encoding
To encode a file (inscluding images, txt etc...) into Base64, run the following command:
  python base64_encode.py
2. Base64 Decoding
To decode a Base64 encoded file, use the following command:
  python base64_decode.py
